# GTEx-RNAseq-pipeline
This repository contains WDL workflows for processing RNA seq data using FASTQ or BAM inputs. This is a clone of the GTEx Consortium RNAseq repo with minor improvements, please see: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/tree/master/rnaseq

Please note that the WDL here is written in WDL draft-2 and is not directly transferable to WDL 1.0 or development.
